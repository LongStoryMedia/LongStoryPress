# LSP_UI

This is where we build the ``React`` frontend along with it's ssr counterpart and the node reverse proxy. As shown the [root](https://github.com/LongStoryMedia/LongStoryPress), environmental variables affecting the build are separated into adjacent folders named by their respective URLs where the scripts are run from. This is also the reason for the ``process.chdir('../LSP_UI')`` at the top of the ``build`` and ``start`` scripts. Without that, ``process.cwd()`` (which is heavily relied on in the config files) would be the adjacent URL folder rather than this one. It would probably make sense to add this kind of information commented into the source files... maybe someday.
Another note on this, the ``package.json`` in this repo __does not have scripts__. The scripts should be run from the sibling folders named by the site URL, like [example.com](https://github.com/LongStoryMedia/LongStoryPress/tree/master/LSP_UI/example.com). The names of these folders should be the URL of the site (without protocol), so that the ``webpack.config`` and ``scripts`` can properly resolve the dotenv files specific to that site.
